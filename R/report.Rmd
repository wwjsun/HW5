#Abstract 
The study compared patients undergoing aortic surgery following one vs. multiple cardiac intervention. 

#Patients and methods
The data contains 360 subjects who had their first re-do aortic surgery and 69 subjects who had multiple re-do aortic surgeries. The four hundred and twenty-nine patients all came from the same US academic healthcare system. 

#Results
We're able to summarize the important variables for the Frist_Redo vs. Multiple_Redo analysis. 
```{r, Table_Redo, echo = FALSE}

Table_Redo <- readRDS(here::here( "figs", "Table_Redo.rds"
))
Table_Redo
```


The Kaplan Meier survival curve for both group looks like this: 
```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("figs", "KM_figure.png"))
```
#Discussion
As we see in Figure \@ref(fig:KM_figure.png), the multiple redo group has a sharp drop within 30 days compare to the first redo group.
